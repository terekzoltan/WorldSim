# Review Findings Registry

Purpose:
- Capture reusable findings from plan reviews, step reviews, deep reviews, and post-review fix loops.
- Keep entries short and actionable so future Track agents can avoid repeated mistakes.
- Record only findings worth reusing; do not duplicate every routine review note.

Entry format:

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD - <Target> - <Severity> - <Short title>

- Track: <Track / role>
- Source: <review type, commit, PR, or doc reference>
- Finding: <what was wrong or risky>
- Impact: <why it matters>
- Resolution / guidance: <what to do next time>
- Status: open | fixed | guidance
```

Severity guide:
- `blocking`: must be fixed before commit or step closeout.
- `major`: likely bug, regression, ownership violation, or missing verification.
- `minor`: non-blocking improvement or maintainability issue.
- `guidance`: reusable process/coordination note.
